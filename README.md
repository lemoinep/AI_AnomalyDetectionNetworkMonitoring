This project implements an AI-powered network anomaly detection system designed to monitor and analyze network traffic in real time. Using machine learning techniques, the programs automatically identify unusual patterns and deviations from normal network behavior that may indicate security threats, performance issues, or unauthorized access. The system collects and preprocesses network data, extracts relevant features, trains anomaly detection models, and provides real-time alerts and visualizations to help network administrators quickly detect and respond to potential anomalies. Its adaptive approach reduces false positives by learning normal traffic patterns and continuously improving through feedback and retraining.
